This application provides an interface, which enables Windows/GNULinux users to type Malayalam in a comfortable way. It would enable users to switch between English and Malayalam keyboard layout and make the tedious task of typing Malayalam using normal US keyboard, much easier by providing fewer keystrokes for all letters including mixed characters and Phonemes.

The MCA students of MACFAST had come across the need for an easier way to use the keyboard for malayalam users and had taken up this project successfully. This product can be downloaded free of cost from the Macfast website for anyone wanting to use the same thereby uploading the highest principles of learning by contributing to the society and community at large by finding a solution to a problem faced by Malayalam keyboard users.
